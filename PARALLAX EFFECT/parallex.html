                  <p class="text">Adventure Time (formerly known as Adventure Time with Finn and Jake) was an American animated <br>television series created by Pendleton Ward and produced by Frederator Studios<br>. The show was based on an original animated short titled "Adventure Time," which <br>aired on Frederator's Random! Cartoons show and won an Annie Award for the Best Animated Short<br> Subject of 2009-2014.</p><br><br>
                 <p class="text">Adventure Time is the source of much of my happiness. Considering the rabid fans out <br>there, you’d think I wouldn’t even have to explain Adventure Time.Five years, six seasons and countless<br> comic and game adaptations later, Adventure Time still commands a powerful (and creative!) fan community. You either get<br> it or you don’t. You like cute animations and silly adventures, or you don’t. The quirky humor jibes with you or it doesn’t.</p></p>

                 </div>
                 <p class="text">Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes.<br> Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain,<br> such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger <br>frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories:<br> cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.[1]</p><br><br>
                <p class="text">This sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced<br> riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt<br> jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and<br> ramps.[2]</p>

                    <h2 class="disc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text"> paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities.<br> Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy<br> acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be <br>inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.</p><br><br>
                <p class="text">Paragliding is one of the simplest forms of flight and easiest to get involved in. It’s a popular <br>hobby for those who not only enjoy the skill and thrill of flight, but also enjoy the outdoors and the <br>amazing overhead views obtainable.However, like other forms of flight, paragliding takes time to learn and <br>master. There are dangers involved and loss of control, sudden weather change, or <br>mishandled equipment can result in death.

                    <h2 class="disc">SURFING</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing),<br> uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually<br> carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,<br> but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore,<br> or in wave pools.</p><br><br>
                <p class="text">The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance.<br> There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the<br> native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures <br>often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer <br>riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
